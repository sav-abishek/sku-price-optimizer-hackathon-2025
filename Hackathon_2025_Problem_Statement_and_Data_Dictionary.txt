Round 1 Price Elasticity
Problem Statement
Your task is to develop a statistical or machine learning model that quantifies the own -price  and cross -price elasticities  for our product portfolio in one of ABI’s market.
• Own -Price Elasticity:  Model the change in volume for each product in response to a change in its own price. The model should reflect the expected m arket behavior of negative elasticity 
(i.e., as price increases, volume decreases).
• Cross -Price Elasticity:  Quantify how a change in the price of one product affects the demand for other products in the portfolio. Your model should i dentify and quantify cannibalization, 
particularly between substitutable products (e.g., within the same brand, beer type, or similar pack sizes). We expect a posi tive cross -elasticity, indicating that an increase in the price of 
one product drives an increase in demand for its substitutes.
IMPORTANT : Your model must provide own -elasticity for each SKU in the data. Additionally, each of these SKUs should have cross -elasticiti es with at least 2 -3 other ABI SKUs and 1 -2 
Competition (Non - ABI) SKUs.
SKU Name Identifier  = CONCAT(Brand, Sub -brand, Package, Package Type, Capacity Number, “cc”)
Deliverables
Your submission for Round 1 must include:
1. Volume Predictions: The output from your elasticity model for the volume prediction on the test data
2. Elasticity Matrix:  Pairwise SKU own and cross price elasticities for all SKUs in the test data
Evaluation Criteria
1. Score = 0.25 * Adj R2 + 0.25 * wMAPE  + 0.5*Elasticity Adherence
2. Elasticity Adherence Criteria:
o Own Elasticity should be negative
o Cross Elasticity should be positive
o Every SKU should have cross elasticities for atleast  2 other ABI SKUs and 2 non -ABI SKUs

Round 2 Pricing Optimizer (1/3)
In this round, you'll leverage your elasticity matrix to create a powerful pricing optimizer . The goal is to move from analysis to action by designing a new pricing structure that maximizes our 
Margin of Contribution (MACO) while adhering to key business constraints.
Problem Statement
Using the own and cross -price elasticities from Round 1, your task is to build a pricing optimization engine  that recommends an optimal set of prices for the entire product portfolio at a SKU  
level for different PINCs (Price Increases) at a national level. The primary objective is to maximize the overall MACO  for the market.
User Inputs
The optimization must be performed on the full portfolio based on these user inputs :
• A National PINC (Price Increase)  that needs to be reallocated across SKUs
• Price Bounds:  Bounds for the recommended price changes at SKU level
Example - 
o MIN:  Current PTC (Price to Consumer) - 300
o MAX:  Current PTC + 500
Some important formulae:  
o MACO = NR - VILC 
o NR = NR/unit * Sales units 
o Discount% = Discount/GTO
o Excise% = Excise/GTO
o NR/unit =(( PTC/(1+markup))*(1 -Discount% -Excise%) )/(1+VAT) [Assume VAT as 19%]
o Sales unit = (volume * 100000)/ Pack Size
o Target VILC = Base VILC (1+ VILC Growth Rate ) [Assume VILC Growth Rate as 3.78%]

Round 2 Pricing Optimizer (2/3)
Contraints
Your optimizer must adhere to the following hard constraints :
• Volume should change in accordance with the Industry Volume model: The final volume must be connected to the PCC model, using elasticities as inputs to determine the new volume 
mix across the different products in the country. Total Industry Volume should not decline by more than 1%.
o New Industry Volume = (1 -.56*price change) * Old Industry Volume
• Financial Target:  The target MACO (model output) must be higher than the base MACO (current year).
• Volume Target:  The target volume (model output) should not decrease by more than 1% or increase by more than 5% compared to the base volume (current year).
• Total Price Increase (PINC):  The overall portfolio price increase can be between 0 -6%, based on a user -defined input.
• Market Share:  ABI's market share should not drop by more than 0.5%.
• Pricing Multiples:  All recommended price changes must be in multiples of 50.
You must also consider soft constraints  to maintain brand hierarchy:
• The Net Revenue per Hectoliter (NR/HL) of different segments must follow the established hierarchy: Value < Core < Core+ < Pr emium < Super Premium.
• The NR/HL architecture of size groups must follow the hierarchy: Small > Regular > Large.
▪Small: An SKU is considered small if the pack_size  is less than 300.
▪Regular: An SKU is considered regular if its pack_type  is 'CAN' and its pack_size  is between 300 and 399 (inclusive), or if its pack_type  is 'RB' or 'NRB' and its pack_size  is 
between 300 and 599 (inclusive).
▪Large: An SKU is considered large if its pack_type  is 'CAN' and its pack_size  is greater than 399, or if its pack_type  is 'RB' or 'NRB' and its pack_size  is greater than 599.

Round 2 Pricing Optimizer (3/3)
Deliverables
Your submission for Round 2 must include:
1. Pricing Optimizer:  The operational code for your optimization model. The model should take the elasticity matrix and user inputs (like PINC targ et and Price Bounds) and output the optimal pricing 
recommendations.
2. Optimized Pricing Plan:  The final pricing recommendation plan and its impact. 
o Overall Summary:   This table should clearly show the old price, new price, and the projected impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) , including:
1. Volume
2. Net Revenue (NR)
3. NR per Hectoliter (NR/HL)
4. MACO
5. MACO per Hectoliter (MACO/HL)
o SKU level pricing architecture: A visualization of the new and old prices across SKUs based on the recommendations from the optimizer for the user defined PI NC
3. Build an optimizer  front -end feature that can be integrated with the BrewVision  tool
Please note : Additional data for the Pricing Optimizer shall be shared after completion of Round1

Long Term Equity
Round 1
1.Predict Brand Power
2.Clear articulation of how long it takes for each of the 
marketing actions to reflect in PowerRound 2
1. Optimize Marketing Investments to drive Power
2. Develop an interactive simulator tool for Power
3. Integrate a GenAI  chatbot layer that explains results in 
simple, business -friendly language (Good to have)
4. Submit Github  repo for AI evaluationBackground
Brand Power is a leading indicator of market share and a growing strategic metric, with many teams already setting Power targ ets. Today, most marketing is 
optimized for short -term sales, but sales alone don’t reflect brand health. This exercise shifts focus to long -term equity - understanding how marketing builds 
Brand Power and how long it takes to show measurable impact. The goal is to guide smarter investments that drive both sales and sustainable brand strength.Problem Statement
Analyse  the long -term impact of marketing activities on Brand Power
